#i want  to run my test cases on cloud not on local machine
remote=true

#difference beween constant and config
#config means the overall framewrok you are developing waht is configuration for that
#Config means on which browser you want to run , on which url you want to run,
#what is headless and  incogito you want to maintain
#constant means what are you use in your test cases

#go to driverfactory and write one method

#right now we are running test cases with the help of config.properties but what if we want to run our 
#test cases on different environment
#we have to set up multi environment concept in out framework also
# we have qa, dev, prod environment
# we have different URL for different environment, may be username and password is difeerent

#But layout wise application will remain same
#we have to run same test cases on other environment also,
# because same build will be updated on QA, DEv and other environments
# where we can update it, go to resource, go to config
# for environment specific we can create number of properties file
#we have 4 different properties file and driver factory class is responsible for that
